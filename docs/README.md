    This site is a fork/clone of Jasspa's microemacs versioned 20100503. The
*goal* is to provide an one-stop experience for obtaining, installing and
running microemacs. 
    
    Additionally, if possible, we would like to clean and re-factor the code 
base, to keep microemacs continually to shine over the time.
